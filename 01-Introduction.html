                Separation processes are a fundamental
                <i>unit-operation</i>

                All raw materials (e.g., ores, crude oil, foodstuffs) are found
                in an impure state and must be separated before being fed into
                other plant processes.

                Products from reactors and other unit operations (e.g., alcohol
                from fermentation, synthesis of drugs) usually exit the process
                in low concentrations and must separated from the feedstock
                elements (which can be recycled) before the final product is
                obtained.

                Thus we can identify three general areas of separation: (1)
                input purification, (2) reactant recovery to increase
                yield/conversion, and (3) product purification.

                All separation processes exploit either a mechanical/physical
                difference or a thermodynamic difference between two or more
                components to effect a separation. I.e.,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"
                  >mass spectroscopy</a
                >

                The separation of multiple components is generally called
                <b>fractionation</b> and it can be carried out by repeated
                binary splits. In this course we focus mainly on binary systems
                for simplicity, even lumping many real components into a single
                "pseudo" component to make the system binary! E.g., consider the
                binary air-water system, which is actually H<sub>2</sub>O,
                O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> etc.

                There are many terms for separation but many only communicate
                the perspective of the engineer designing the separation. For
                example, <b>purification</b>
                usually indicates the designing engineer wants high
                concentrations and may not care about recovering the impurities,
                but it does not describe the underlying method.

                There are of course more exact terms which describe the actual

                The thermodynamic (non-mechanical) approaches can be classified
                into two major categories of separation processes:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Equilibrium (limited) processes:</b> <br />
                    In equilibrium processes, two phases (vapour, liquid or
                    solid) are brought to contact with each other,
                    <b>mixed thoroughly</b>, then separated with a
                    redistribution of the components between phases. Multiple
                    contacts are often made in a series of cascading steps in
                    which the two-phases flow counter-current to each other. At
                    each contact, the phases approach thermodynamic equilibrium.
                    One example of an equilibrium limited process is
                    <b>distillation</b>. Such processes are often designed
                    through algebraic balance equations.
                  </li>
                  <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
                    <b>Mass-Transfer limited processes (rate-limited):</b>
                    <br />
                    In mass-transfer limited processes, one component of a feed
                    stream is transferred from the feed phase into a second
                    phase due to a chemical potential/pressure gradient.
                    Although thermodynamics are again driving the separation,
                    the limiting step upon which design is based is the rate of
                    transfer of the particular component from the feed material
                    to the second phase. One example of a rate-limited process
                    is <b>membrane separation</b>. Such processes are often
                    designed through differential balances.

              <li class="fragment">
                Its important to note that &ldquo;equilibrium&rdquo; processes
                also have mass-transfer limitations which must be modelled to
                determine the size of the process equipment (and we will come
                back to this in plate/packed column design) but these are small
                enough that we can construct equipment which approaches the
                thermodynamic limitations of the system.
