		Each student will be assigned <b>one</b> lab session
		to perform <b>either</b> the Distillation
		lab <b>OR</b> the Absorption lab via
		MyTimetable. Which experiment is assigned depends on
		the attendance on the day.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		If you wish to change your lab time slot, you must
		find someone willing to exchange with you and to
		confirm with me before the lab takes place, otherwise
		only the scheduled person will be admitted to the lab.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<b>Attendance at the lab session is mandatory to pass the course.</b>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		You must bring your lab coat, a log book, your safety
		glasses, your ID card, and a printed copy of both lab
		handbooks with you to your assigned lab session (read
		in advance). You will assit the other team on their
		experiment and so need to understand both experiments.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		If you are unprepared for your lab
		session you will be refused entry and will have to
		resit the lab session.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Your conduct in the lab will be monitored and any
		unsafe or careless/dangerous behaviour will result in
		the termination of the lab for your group, regardless
		of your progress. This may result in a failure of the
		course.

		Your report must be typed and submitted to the
		TurnItIn link on MyAberdeen by the deadline (See the
		turnitin link). Late penalties will be applied!
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Students performing the distillation lab will have to wait for the analysis of their samples via the GC.

	  <section data-menu-title="General Advice">
	    <p>
	      I expect to see citations, an abstract, conclusions, and plenty of reasoning.
	      
	      Your report should cover no more than 10 sides of A4
	      (this includes everything, e.g. titles, blank pages,
	      appendices - no exceptions). Key to achieving high marks
	      in the report is remaining concise, consistent, and
	      covering all relevant topics and reasoning. Do not
	      repeat any material from the handouts (I do not want to
	      write my procedure again, I am very familiar with it),
	      you may put a brief description of the experimental
	      method but only go into details about anything you think
	      was key (i.e., something which may explain your
	      results). The report should tell me how you managed to
	      calculate as much interesting information about the
	      performance of the column as you can. I.e., I want to
	      know about how many theoretical stages each column is
	      capable of performing, heat losses, efficiencies, mass
	      flows, etc. and how/why your results are correct. If you
	      cannot tell me an exact value for something then tell me
	      the range in which it must lie. The narrower you can
	      successfully determine the range the better. Remember,
	      I'm not looking for a particular value or measurement,
	      or answer. I want evidence that you understand what the
	      column is doing and that you understand the contents of
	      the course.
	      
	      <br/>
	      Academic writing should always be written as impersonal present tense. This forces you to explain the results more clearly. For example,
	      <br/>
	      Bad: We went to the column and I read through the instructions provided to operate the column
	      <br/>
	      Good: The experiments are carried out according to the lab procedure (see Ref. [1]).
	      <br/>
	      Bad: The efficiency was lower than expected as we made a mistake in setting the water flowrate.
	      <br/>
	      Good: The water flow-rate is set to 0.9 l/hr during operation which is lower than the 1.2 l/hr value recommended in the lab procedure and may explain the reduced efficiency. This changes the slope of the operating line...
